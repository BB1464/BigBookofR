If youre like me, you cant help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful. Hopefully this is the only bookmark youll need in future ;). When I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that Id been collecting over the previous two years. Since then Ive found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at about 250 books. Most of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable. 1.2 Searching If theres something specific youre looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. 1.3 Contributing Please feel free to contribute paid and free books - see GitHub. 1.4 Contributors If youve contributed, add your name and Twitter / blog link below!

Im guessing that if youre interested in R then you also like data ;). I initially used Google Analytics for this site but as Im keen to enhance user privacy I switched to Plausible Analytics from 30 December 2020 onward. You can view the old Google Analytics summary report PDF here. TLDR 22k unique visitors and 33k sessions between August 2020 and December 2020 :D!! Note that unique visits will be higher in Plausible than youd find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, thats counted as 2 uniques whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users. From now on, you can view the LIVE site stats right here. 1.7 About me Im Oscar. Fairly new to R and loving it. If you like this book, feel free to say Hi! on Twitter.

One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations. Link: https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/ 5.2 Quantitative Methods in Archaeology Using R The first hands-on guide to using the R statistical computing system written specifically for archaeologists. It shows how to use the system to analyze many types of archaeological data. Part I includes tutorials on R, with applications to real archaeological data showing how to compute descriptive statistics, create tables, and produce a wide variety of charts and graphs. Part II addresses the major multivariate approaches used by archaeologists, including multiple regression (and the generalized linear model); multiple analysis of variance and discriminant analysis; principal components analysis; correspondence analysis; distances and scaling; and cluster analysis. Part III covers specialized topics in archaeology, including intra-site spatial analysis, seriation, and assemblage diversity.

Horton This book is intended for readers who want to develop the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects and think with data (as coined by Diane Lambert of Google). The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach. We acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly. This book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or statistics experience.
